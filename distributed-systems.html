            <p>
                The CAP theorem, also known as Brewer's theorem, is one of the most fundamental concepts in 
                distributed systems. It states that any distributed system can provide at most two of the 
                following three guarantees: Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance.
            </p>
            
            <h2>The Three Guarantees</h2>
            
            <h3>Consistency (C)</h3>
            <p>
                Consistency means that all nodes in the distributed system see the same data at the same time. 
                When a write operation completes, all subsequent read operations must return the updated value, 
                regardless of which node serves the request.
            </p>
            <p>
                In practical terms, this means that if you update a user's profile on one server, that change 
                should be immediately visible when accessing the profile from any other server in the system.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Availability (A)</h3>
            <p>
                Availability guarantees that the system remains operational and responsive to requests. 
                Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent data. 
                The system continues to function even when some nodes fail.
            </p>
            <p>
                A highly available system ensures that users can always interact with the application, 
                even during server failures or network issues, though they might occasionally see stale data.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Partition Tolerance (P)</h3>
            <p>
                Partition tolerance means the system continues to operate despite network failures that 
                split the system into multiple isolated groups of nodes. The system can handle communication 
                breakdowns between nodes and still function correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
                In real-world distributed systems, network partitions are inevitable due to hardware failures, 
                network congestion, or configuration errors. Therefore, partition tolerance is typically 
                considered a requirement rather than an option.
            </p>
            
            <h2>The Trade-offs</h2>
            <p>
                Since network partitions are unavoidable in distributed systems, the practical choice 
                is usually between consistency and availability:
            </p>
            
            <h3>CP Systems (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)</h3>
            <p>
                CP systems prioritize consistency over availability. When a network partition occurs, 
                the system may become unavailable to maintain data consistency across all nodes.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MongoDB:</strong> Can be configured for strong consistency</li>
                <li><strong>HBase:</strong> Provides strong consistency guarantees</li>
                <li><strong>Redis Cluster:</strong> Maintains consistency during partitions</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>AP Systems (Availability + Partition Tolerance)</h3>
            <p>
                AP systems prioritize availability over consistency. The system remains operational 
                during network partitions but may serve stale or inconsistent data.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cassandra:</strong> Highly available with eventual consistency</li>
                <li><strong>DynamoDB:</strong> Designed for high availability</li>
                <li><strong>CouchDB:</strong> Focuses on availability and eventual consistency</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Beyond CAP: Practical Considerations</h2>
            
            <h3>Eventual Consistency</h3>
            <p>
                Many modern distributed systems implement eventual consistency, where the system 
                will become consistent over time, once network partitions are resolved and all 
                updates have propagated.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Tunable Consistency</h3>
            <p>
                Some systems allow you to tune consistency levels per operation. For example, 
                Cassandra allows you to specify consistency levels like ONE, QUORUM, or ALL 
                for individual read and write operations.
            </p>
            
            <h3>PACELC Theorem</h3>
            <p>
                The PACELC theorem extends CAP by addressing system behavior during normal operation 
                (when there are no partitions). It states that in case of network partitioning (P), 
                one has to choose between availability (A) and consistency (C), but else (E), 
                even when the system is running normally, one has to choose between latency (L) and consistency (C).
            </p>
            
            <h2>Design Implications</h2>
            
            <h3>Choose Based on Requirements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Financial systems:</strong> Often choose CP for data accuracy</li>
                <li><strong>Social media:</strong> Typically choose AP for user experience</li>
                <li><strong>E-commerce:</strong> May use different strategies for different data types</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Hybrid Approaches</h3>
            <p>
                Many real-world systems use hybrid approaches, applying different consistency models 
                to different types of data based on business requirements. Critical data might use 
                strong consistency while less critical data uses eventual consistency.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Best Practices</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand your application's consistency requirements</li>
                <li>Design for partition tolerance from the beginning</li>
                <li>Consider using different consistency models for different data types</li>
                <li>Implement monitoring to detect and handle network partitions</li>
                <li>Test your system's behavior during various failure scenarios</li>
                <li>Document your consistency guarantees for other developers</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                The CAP theorem provides a valuable framework for understanding the fundamental 
                trade-offs in distributed systems. While it presents constraints, understanding 
                these limitations helps architects make informed decisions about system design 
                and choose appropriate technologies for their specific use cases.
